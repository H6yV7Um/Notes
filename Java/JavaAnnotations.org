#+TITLE: Java Annotations

* Annotations
Annotations provide information about your program, or the elements of that program(classes, methods, fields, 
variables, and so forth), in a structured way that is amenable to automated processing by external tools.

An annotation is considered a modifier(like =public= or =static=) and should appear before other midifiers on a line.

It is indicated by an *@* character followed by the name of an annotation type. Example to define an annotation type.
#+begin_src java
@interface Reviewed { // an annotation type is a special kind of interface
  String reviewer();
  int date();
}
#+end_src

For package annotations, you can create a file called /package-info.java/ within the package directory, and put in 
the file nothing but a package statement with any annotations for the package(plus any useful comments, of course).
