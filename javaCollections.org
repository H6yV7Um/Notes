* Collection Interface
=Iterator<E> iterator()= returns an object that implements the =Iterator= interface.

In addition, it delcares quite a few methods, =int size()=, =boolean isEmpty()=, =boolean contains(Object obj)=, 
=boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)=, =boolean equals(Object oth)=, =boolean add(E c)=, 
=boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> f)=, =boolean remove(Object obj)=, =boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)=, 
=void clear()=, =Object[] toArray()=. 
There is no =get= method.

To simple the implemetation, abstract class =AbstractCollection= implements 
all of them except =size= method and =iterator= method.

* Iterator Interface 
It has three methods
- =E next()=  to get the elements one by one, throws =NoSuchElementException= if you reach its end.
- =boolean hasNext()= to check if has more elements in it.
- =void remove()= to remove element returned by the last call to =next= method
 
 Usually, iterator has been replaced by /foreach/ statement, which uses iterator implicitly. But you cannot remove 
 element in /foreach/ block, you have to use /remove/ method of iterator. 

You should invoke =hasNext= method before =next= method.

Unlike iterator in c++, iterator in Java does not support "++" operation.
* List
/ArrayList/ and /LinkedList/ are both types of /List/, they both hold elements in the order in which elements are 
inserted, the difference is not only performs for certain tyoes of operation, but also that /LinkedList/ contains 
more operations than /ArrayList/.

/Vector/ and /Stack/ are randomly used, but you may see them in old code.

=Arrays.asList(T...)= (/Arrays/ is subclass of /Object/) produces a /List/ that is backed by a fixed-size array, 
it makes sense that the only supported operations are the one that do not change the size of the array. You can
always pass the result of it as a constructor argument to any /Collection/.

The "unmodifiable" methods(like =unmodifiableList=, =unmodifiableMap=, etc) in the /Collections/ class wrap the 
container(like /List/, /Map/, etc) in a proxy that produces an /UnsupprtedOperationException/ if you perfprm any 
operation that modifies the container in any way.
#+begin_src java
List<String> a = Arrays.asList("qwe", "234");
//a.add("12"); //UnsupportedOperationException  		
List<String> t = new LinkedList<String>(a); 
t.add("12dd");
List<String> q = Collections.unmodifiableList(t);
//q.add("asdf"); //UnsupportedOperationException
#+end_src
** ArrayList
The capacity of an object of ArrayList can be automatically adjusted when adding or removing elements.

If you already know how many elements you want to store, call =ensureCapacity= method before filling the array list. 
#+begin_src java
ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<Employee>();

staff.ensureCapacity(100);
//use the add method to fill up
staff.add(new Employee())
//use the set method  only to replace a previously added element
if(i<staff.size())
  staff.set(i, new Employee());
//returns the actual number of elements in the array list.
staff.size();
//reduce the storage capacity of the array list to its current size
staff.trimToSize(); 
//copy the elements into an array
Employee[] e = new Employee[staff.size()];
staff.toArray(a);
#+end_src

It is recomended to use an /ArrayList/ instead of a /Vector/ whenever you do not need synchronization.
 
** LinkedList
It is expensive to remove an element from the middle of an array or array list.

=add= method addes an element at the end of a linked list.
=listIteratoe= method return a suninterface /ListIterator/. While /Iterator/ can only move foward, 
/ListIterator/ is bidirectional. /ListIterator/ extends Iterator, and has methods 
=void add(E e)=, =E previous()= and =boolean hasPrevious()=. You can use this =add= method to add an element 
just before the element returned by the last call to =next= method(perhaps in the middle of a linked list), but 
the iterator keeps at the position of the element returned by =next= method.

* Set
A /Set/ only holds one of each identical item, so the elements added to it must at least define /equals/ method.
** HashSet
Elements must define /hashCode/ method. 

There is no guarantee as to the order in which the elements will be returned when traversing the set.

It is unsychronized and not thread-safe.
#+begin_src java
Set<Character> s1 = new HashSet<Character>(8);
s1.add('a');
s1.add('b');
s1.add('j');
#+end_src

When traversing the set, the order in which elements are returned depends on their hash code, 
** LinkedHashSet
It keeps the objects in the order in which they were added. Elements must define /hashCode/ method.

It guarantees that its iterator will return their elements in the order in which the elements added.

It is unsychronized and not thread-safe.

#+begin_src java
Set<Character> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<Character>(8);
Collections.addAll(s2, 'a', 'b', 'j');
#+end_src

** CopyOnWriteArraySet
It is implemented as a thin wrapper around an instance of /CopyOnWriteArrayList/, which in turn is backed by 
an immutable array. 

** TreeSet
The interface /Comparator/ has two methods: =int compare(T o1, T o2)= and =boolean equals(Object obj)=. 
The interface /Comparable/ has one method: =int compareTo(T o)=. 

/TreeSet/ keeps the objects 
- in the order specified by /Comparator/ which can be provided when constructing an empty tree set. or, 
- in natural ordering of its elements. Elements must implement /Comparable/ interface.

/TreeSet/ is unsynchronized and not thread-safe.
** SortedSet and NavigableSet
/TreeSet/ has implemented /NavigableSet/, which extends /SortedSet/.

/SortedSet/ will use /compare/ method of its /Comparator/ - or, if it does not have one, the /compareTo/ 
method of its elements-instead of the elements's /equals/ method to determine when elements are distinct. 

Methods declared by the /SortedSet/ interface:
- Getting the first and last elements
 - E first()
 - E last()
 
  if the set is empty, these operations throw /NoSuchElementException/.
- Retrieving the /Comparator/
 - Comparator<? super E> comparator()
  
  returns the set's comparator if it has been given at the construction time. 

  =Comparator<? super E>= is used because /SortedSet/ can rely on a /Comparator/ defined on any super type of /E/.
- Getting range views
 
 What you do in the view will be reflected in the original set.

 The arguments to these methods do not themselves have to be members of the set.
 - SortedSet<E> subSet(E from, E to)
  
  returns a view containing every element of the original set that is greater than or equal to /from/ and less than /to/
 - SortedSet<E> headSet(E to)
  
  returns a view containing every element of the original set that is less than /to/.
 - SortedSet<E> tailSet(E from)

  returns a view containing every element of the original set that is greater than or equal to /from/.  
 
Methods declared by /NavigableSet/:
- Getting and removing the first and last elements
 - E pollFirst()
 - E pollLast()
- Getting range views
 - NavigableSet<E> subSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive, E to, boolean toInclusive)
 - NavigableSet<E> headSet(E to, boolean toInclusive) 
 - NavigableSet<E> tailSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive)
- Getting closest matches
 - E ceiling(E e)
  
  returns the least element greater than, or equal to e
 - E floor(E e)
  
  returns the greatest element less than, or equal to e
 - E higher(E e)

  returns the least element strictly greater than e
 - E lower(E e)

  returns the greatest element strictly less than e
- Navigating the set in reverse order
 - NavigableSet<E> descendingSet()

  returns a reverse-order view
 - Iterable<E> descendingIterator()

  returns a reverse-order iterator
* Maps
/LinkedHashMap/, /HashMap/ and /TreeMap/ implement the /Map/ interface. /HashMap/ provides the fastest lookpup 
technique, and does not hold elements in any apparent order. /TreeMap/ keeps the keys sorted by ascending comparison 
order. /LinkedHashMap/ keeps the keys in insertion order while retaining the lookup speed of the /HashMap/.

Any key must have an /equals/ method. If the key is used in a hashed /Map/, it must also have a proper /hashCode/ 
method. If the key is used in a /TreeMap/, it must implements /Comparable/ interface.
